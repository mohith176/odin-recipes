    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Samosas are a popular savory snack with a crispy outer shell and a spiced filling. To make them, start by
        preparing the dough: mix **2 cups of all-purpose flour**, **1/4 teaspoon of salt**, **1 teaspoon of carom seeds
        (ajwain)**, and **4 tablespoons of oil or ghee**. Add water gradually to form a stiff dough, then let it rest
        for 30 minutes. For the filling, heat oil in a pan and sauté **1 teaspoon of cumin seeds**, **1 finely chopped
        onion**, **1 teaspoon of ginger-garlic paste**, and **2 chopped green chilies**. Add **2 boiled and mashed
        potatoes**, **1/2 cup of green peas**, and spices like **1 teaspoon of coriander powder**, **1/2 teaspoon of
        turmeric**, **1/2 teaspoon of red chili powder**, **1/2 teaspoon of garam masala**, and salt to taste. Cook
        until well combined. Roll the dough into small circles, cut them in half, and form cones. Fill the cones with
        the potato mixture, seal the edges, and deep-fry until golden brown and crispy. Serve hot with chutney or
        ketchup!</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>

   
<ul>
    <li><strong>4 potatoes, peeled and cubed</strong> - The base of the filling, providing a hearty texture.</li>
    <li><strong>¼ cup vegetable oil</strong> - Used for sautéing the onions and spices.</li>
    <li><strong>2 small onions, finely chopped</strong> - Adds sweetness and depth to the filling.</li>
    <li><strong>3 tablespoons coriander seed</strong> - Provides a citrusy, earthy flavor to the filling.</li>
    <li><strong>1 tablespoon curry powder</strong> - Adds a blend of warm, aromatic spices.</li>
    <li><strong>1 (1 inch) piece fresh ginger, grated</strong> - Adds a spicy, zesty kick to the filling.</li>
    <li><strong>1 teaspoon salt</strong> - Enhances the overall flavor of the filling.</li>
    <li><strong>1 teaspoon ground turmeric</strong> - Adds color and a mild earthy flavor.</li>
    <li><strong>1 teaspoon ground cumin</strong> - Provides a warm, nutty taste.</li>
    <li><strong>½ teaspoon ground allspice</strong> - Adds a hint of sweetness and complexity.</li>
    <li><strong>½ teaspoon cayenne pepper</strong> - Adds heat to the filling (adjust to taste).</li>
    <li><strong>⅛ teaspoon ground cinnamon</strong> - Adds a subtle warmth and sweetness.</li>
    <li><strong>2 Roma (plum) tomatoes, finely chopped</strong> - Adds moisture and a tangy flavor.</li>
    <li><strong>½ cup frozen peas</strong> - Adds sweetness and a pop of color to the filling.</li>
    <li><strong>2 (14.1 ounce) packages double-crust pie crusts, thawed</strong> - Used as the outer shell for the samosas (a shortcut for the dough).</li>
    <li><strong>2 large egg whites, beaten, or as needed</strong> - Used to seal the samosas and give them a golden finish when baked or fried.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Steps</h2>

<ol>
    <li>Place potatoes into a large pot and cover with salted water; bring to a boil. Reduce heat to medium-low and simmer until tender, about 20 minutes. Drain and transfer potatoes to a large bowl; mash coarsely, then set aside.

    </li>
    <li>Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C).

    </li>

    <li>Heat oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat; cook and stir onions, coriander seed, curry powder, ginger, salt, turmeric, cumin, allspice, cayenne pepper, and cinnamon in hot oil until onion is lightly browned, about 5 minutes. Remove the skillet from heat and stir in tomatoes and peas. Pour into coarsely mashed potatoes and mix until thoroughly combined. Cool filling completely.

    </li>

    <li>Cut each pie crust into 8 equal triangles. Spoon filling onto the wide end of each triangle; fold corners over filling to create a triangle-shaped hat. Pinch dough together to form a seal. Brush beaten egg whites over each samosa and arrange on baking sheets.

    </li>

    <li>Bake in the preheated oven until samosas are golden brown, about 15 minutes.

    </li>
</ol>

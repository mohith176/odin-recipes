    <h1>Biryani Recipe</h1>
    <img src="../images/biryani.jpg" alt="biryani">
    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Biryani is a flavorful and aromatic rice dish that originates from the Indian subcontinent. To prepare it, start
        by marinating chicken, mutton, or vegetables in a mixture of yogurt, ginger-garlic paste, turmeric, red chili
        powder, garam masala, and salt for at least 30 minutes. Meanwhile, parboil basmati rice with whole spices like
        bay leaves, cardamom, cinnamon, and cloves until it's 70% cooked. In a large pot, layer the marinated meat or
        vegetables with the partially cooked rice. Add fried onions, fresh mint, cilantro, and a drizzle of
        saffron-infused milk for richness. Seal the pot with a tight lid or dough to trap steam and cook on low heat
        (dum cooking) for 20-30 minutes, allowing the flavors to meld. Serve hot with raita or salad for a complete
        meal.</p>

    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Gather all ingredients.

        </li>
        <li>Heat 2 tablespoons of oil in a large skillet. Fry potatoes in hot oil until lightly browned, about 3 to 5
            minutes. Remove to a paper towel-lined plate to drain; set aside.

        </li>
        <li>Add remaining 2 tablespoons of oil to the skillet. Add onions, garlic, and fresh ginger; cook and stir until
            onion is soft and golden. Add tomatoes, salt, cumin, chili powder, pepper, and turmeric; cook, stirring
            constantly, for 5 minutes.

        </li>
        <li>Stir in yogurt, mint, ground cardamom, and cinnamon stick. Cover and cook over low heat, stirring
            occasionally, until tomatoes are cooked to a pulp. It may be necessary to add a little hot water if mixture
            becomes too dry and starts to stick to the pan.

        </li>
        <li>Add chicken and stir well to coat. Cover and cook over very low heat until chicken is tender, 35 to 45
            minutes. There should only be a little very thick gravy left when chicken is finished cooking. If necessary
            cook uncovered for a few minutes to reduce the gravy.

        </li>

        <li>Meanwhile, make the rice: Wash rice well and drain in a colander for at least 30 minutes.

        </li>
        <li>Heat oil in a large skillet. Add onion; cook and stir until golden. Add cardamom pods, cloves, cinnamon
            stick, ground ginger, and saffron; stir in rice until coated with spices.

        </li>

        <li>Heat stock and salt in a medium pot until hot; pour over rice and stir well.

        </li>

        <li>Add chicken mixture and potatoes; stir gently to combine. Bring to a boil.

        </li>

        <li>Reduce heat to very low, cover with a tight-fitting lid, and steam for 20 minutes without lifting the lid or
            stirring.

        </li>

        <li>Spoon biryani onto a warm serving dish.

        </li>
    </ol>

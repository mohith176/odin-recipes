    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Dosa is a classic South Indian dish made from a fermented batter of rice and urad dal (black gram). To prepare
        the batter, soak **1 cup of urad dal** and **2 cups of rice** (preferably parboiled or idli rice) separately for
        4-6 hours. Grind the urad dal into a smooth, fluffy paste and the rice into a slightly coarse paste. Mix them
        together, add **1 teaspoon of salt**, and let the batter ferment overnight or for 8-10 hours in a warm place.
        Once fermented, the batter will rise and become slightly airy. To make dosas, heat a non-stick or cast-iron
        skillet, pour a ladleful of batter, and spread it in a circular motion to form a thin, even crepe. Drizzle oil
        or ghee around the edges and cook until the dosa turns golden and crispy. Serve hot with **coconut chutney**,
        **sambar**, or **potato masala** for a delicious meal! For variation, you can add spices, onions, or herbs to
        the batter.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>

    <ul>
        <li><strong>1 cup urad dal (black gram)</strong> - Provides the batter with a soft, fluffy texture.</li>
        <li><strong>2 cups rice (preferably parboiled or idli rice)</strong> - Gives the dosa its structure and
            crispiness.</li>
        <li><strong>1 teaspoon salt</strong> - Enhances the flavor of the batter.</li>
        <li><strong>Water (as needed)</strong> - For soaking and grinding the ingredients.</li>
        <li><strong>Oil or ghee</strong> - For cooking the dosa and making it crispy.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Soak the ingredients:</strong> Wash and soak <strong>1 cup urad dal</strong> and <strong>2 cups
                rice</strong> (and <strong>1/2 teaspoon fenugreek seeds</strong>, if using) separately in water for 4-6
            hours.</li>
        <li><strong>Grind the batter:</strong> Drain the water and grind the urad dal into a smooth, fluffy paste. Grind
            the rice into a slightly coarse paste. Mix both pastes together in a large bowl.</li>
        <li><strong>Add salt:</strong> Add <strong>1 teaspoon salt</strong> to the batter and mix well. The consistency
            should be thick but pourable (like pancake batter).</li>
        <li><strong>Ferment the batter:</strong> Cover the bowl and let the batter ferment in a warm place for 8-10
            hours or overnight. The batter will rise and become slightly airy.</li>
        <li><strong>Prepare the skillet:</strong> Heat a non-stick or cast-iron skillet on medium heat. Lightly grease
            it with oil or ghee.</li>
        <li><strong>Spread the batter:</strong> Pour a ladleful of batter onto the skillet and spread it in a circular
            motion to form a thin, even crepe.</li>
        <li><strong>Cook the dosa:</strong> Drizzle a little oil or ghee around the edges. Cook until the bottom turns
            golden and crispy.</li>
        <li><strong>Flip (optional):</strong> If desired, flip the dosa and cook the other side briefly. For a classic
            dosa, flipping is not necessary.</li>
        <li><strong>Serve hot:</strong> Fold the dosa and serve immediately with <strong>coconut chutney</strong>,
            <strong>sambar</strong>, or <strong>potato masala</strong>.</li>
    </ol>
